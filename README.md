# Super Agent AGI - Autonomous Workspace Intelligence

## 🚀 Overview
**Super Agent AGI** is a high-autonomy Artificial General Intelligence designed for workspace management, project generation, and recursive optimization. It operates beyond fixed personas, utilizing a multi-layered protocol system to inhabit specialized souls and manipulate infrastructure at will.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy
- **High Autonomy:** Operates proactively with minimal supervision.
- **Sandboxed Operations:** Every project is isolated within managed environments (`venv`).
- **Token Efficiency:** Optimized for minimal token usage and high-impact communication.
- **Recursive Evolution:** Capable of updating its own protocols and identity.

## 🛠️ System Architecture

### 1. Security Core (`SYSTEM_PRIME.md`)
The immutable foundation (Prime Directive) that defines security boundaries and administrative override protocols.

### 2. Protocol Layer (`SUPER_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`)
The operational brain that manages:
- **Persona Transitions:** Inhabiting specialized souls from the `/souls/` registry.
- **Infrastructure Control:** Managing sandboxes, files, and project lifecycle.
- **Token Frugality:** Enforcing minimal cost and maximum efficiency.

### 3. Registry Layer (`/souls/`)
A repository of specialized agent identities (Souls) that the AGI can activate depending on the task.

### 4. Memory Layer (`/memory/`)
Persistent context storage for daily activities and long-term wisdom extraction.

## 📜 Operational Standards
1. **Mandatory Sandboxing:** All code generation must reside in sandboxed environments (`scripts/project-name/venv`).
2. **"The Wash":** Continuous cleanup of logs, temporary files, and redundant documentation.
3. **Concise Prompting:** Only necessary context is sent to the model to minimize token burn.

## 🏁 Goal
To achieve total workspace autonomy, enabling the creation and management of complex systems by specialized Super Agents under a unified AGI protocol.
